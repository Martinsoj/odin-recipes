    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This authentic Italian spaghetti carbonara is silky rich and made with just a handful of ingredients. Unlike Americanized version with cream, this traditional recipe relies on eggs and cheese to create a luxurious sauce that clings to every strand of pasta.</p>
    <p>The key to perfect carbonara is working quickly while the pasta is hot, allowing the eggs to cook gently without scrambling. When done right, it's an impressive yet simple dish that can be prepared in under 30 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li> clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
    </ol>
